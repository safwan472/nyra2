                chapter in her life story?

                Every song I hear reminds me of her. Every movie love scene makes me sad.
                Every couple I see walking together makes my heart ache.
                Life became a constant reminder of what I lost.

            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Sometimes I scroll through old photos. That school group photo where
                she's standing three people away from me. That Valentine's Day I bought
                flowers that stayed in my room and dried up. Small reminders of what could have been.

                She's married now. She's happy. Why should I disturb her peace?

                Did she ever feel anything for me? So many unanswered questions.

                That girl later found someone else. I saw her engagement photos online.
                I genuinely felt happy for her. At least one of us deserves happiness.
                At least she didn't waste time on someone like me who can't move on.

                Every year on Valentine's Day, ath specially painful aanu. Everywhere couples,
                flowers, chocolates, love. Njan aa divasam usually take leave. Room il irunne
                aalochikanum. That failed proposal, those roses that never reached her.

                Friends paranju multiple times, "Professional help eduth bro."
                Maybe they're right. Maybe I do need therapy. Maybe someone professional
                can help me understand why I can't let go. Why I'm stuck in the past.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                But pride comes in the way. "Njan strong aanu, mental aayitt tough aanu"
                enn thonnunnu. But actually, I'm the weakest. Can't even move on from
                someone who was never mine. Can't even fight my own emotions.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Life goes on, people say. But does it really? Or do we just pretend?
                Wear a mask of normalcy while dying inside? Go through motions of daily life
                while heart stays frozen in one moment from the past?
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I look at old couples walking together, holding hands after 50 years of marriage.
                I'll never have that. I'll never grow old with someone. I'll probably end up
                alone. And honestly, I've started to accept that fate.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Parents getting old. Avarkum tension kodukkanum vayya. So I might eventually
                say yes to an arranged marriage. Marry someone nice. Give parents the satisfaction.
                But will I ever truly love that person? I doubt it.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                That seems unfair to whoever I marry. They deserve someone who loves them completely.
                Not someone whose heart is stuck somewhere else. Not someone who's just going
                through motions. They deserve better than me.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Maybe in another life, another universe, we ended up together.
                Maybe there's a version of me who had the courage that day.
                A version who told her everything. A version who's happy now.
                But that's not this me. This me is broken.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I keep that dried rose petals in a book. Those Valentine's Day roses that
                never reached her. Sometimes I open that book and look at them.
                Fragile, brown, lifeless. Just like my heart. A reminder of unrequited love.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Friends posting couple photos, anniversary celebrations, baby announcements...
                I react with heart emoji, type congratulations. But feel nothing inside.
                Actually no, I feel sad. Sad that I'll never experience any of that.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Rain makes me sadder. We used to stand near the window during rain in school.
                Never talked much, but just being near her was enough. Now rain just means
                cold, alone nights with memories rushing back stronger than ever.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I thought time heals everything. People say that. "Time is the best medicine."
                But it's been 8 years. The wound is still fresh. The pain is still sharp.
                Time hasn't healed anything. It just taught me to live with the pain.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Sometimes I wonder if she ever thinks about me. Just randomly.
                In the middle of her married life, does she ever remember that boy from school?
                That boy who used to stare at her? That boy who tried to meet her that day?
                Probably not. I'm probably completely erased from her memory.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                And that's the hardest part. Not being important enough to even be remembered.
                Being a forgettable chapter. A footnote. A "whatever happened to that guy?"
                question that she probably never even asks.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I've accepted my fate now. Some people find their person. Some people don't.
                I'm in the latter category. And maybe that's okay. Maybe not everyone is meant
                to have that fairy tale ending. Maybe my story was meant to be sad.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                But still, every night before sleeping, I think about her. Wonder how she is.
                Hope she's happy. Hope her life is beautiful. And that's love, isn't it?
                Wanting someone to be happy even if it's not with you.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                To anyone reading this... if you love someone, tell them. Don't wait.
                Don't think you have time. Don't overthink. Because one day might be too late.
                And you might end up like me. Living with regret. Living with what-ifs.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Life is short. Too short to keep feelings hidden. Too short to wait for
                perfect moments. Because sometimes the perfect moment never comes.
                And you're left with nothing but memories and regrets.
            </p>
